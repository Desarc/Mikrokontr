\begin{abstract}
In this assignment the goal is to program a simple computer game in C for an AVR32 micro controller running Linux. To accomplish this one needs to understand and write Linux device drivers for I/O. We therefore wrote our own drivers for operating LEDs and switches on the development board. The game we chose to implement is a simple puzzle game called Sokoban.

\section{Introduction}
In this exercise we start out with installing Linux on the STK1000 development board from the SD card. We are now able to write C code that benefits from Linux functions. %Greit nok formulert?  
To be able to communicate with the LEDs and the buttons on the STK1000 development board we wrote a pair of drivers for Linux with great help from \textit{"Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition"} \cite{ldd}


\section{Description and methodology}

%Nevne uboot og bootloader?
First off we started out with trying to install Linux on the STK1000 development board. This turned out to be a tricky affair. We had a step by step guide for compiling Linux that we followed, but with no luck. Luckily there was mentioned an image of a precompiled Linux that we could extract to the SD card. After some mixing back and forth with environment variables from the other \textit{u-boot.bin} file(from itslearning) into the one we were using we finally started to get somewhere. Another group posted a guide on itslearning that worked for us.

Once we had Linux up and running we started out with a simple "Hello world" program to verify that things were working. Now we started out with programming a driver for the LEDs. We sometimes thought we had found the solution regarding how to turn the LEDs on or off, but we weren't quite right yet. We gave the LED driver a pause and started to communicate with the frame buffer in Linux instead. 

In the beginning we thought maybe this file had to be a kernel module as well, but we soon understood that we needed access to quite a few libraries to make the memory mapping work. We started with generating a random bit values for the display and went on with more logical values, for example a third of the screen was made red. As we tried to read bit values from an image of the file format bitmap, we started to see that there were some errors in regards to how we read the file. After a lot of trial and error we finally managed to display the image files properly. We organized the screen into a grid of 20 by 15 tiles built up of 16 by 16 pixels for each tile. This made it easy to map the \textit{charmap} to the images and render the levels on the LCD screen. It is also a fairly convenient size for the game when it comes to the variety of the sizes of each level.

From the previous exercise we learned how to handle sound in C which came in handy for the game sounds. We wanted the player to get good feedback through sound effects by telling the player when he does something right or wrong. Therefore we constructed a negative sound when you hit the wall or removed a crate from a target square and a more positive sound when you push a crate on a target square.

\subsection{The game}
\subsubsection{Sokoban}
The game we chose to implement was a simple top-down puzzle game called \textit{Sokoban}\cite{sokoban}. The point of the game is for the player to push boxes onto marked target squares. The levels are small maps confined by walls which cannot be walked through. The puzzle is solved when all the boxes are on the target squares. We had some previous experience of implementing this game in Java in the course TDT4100: Object Oriented Programming. We therefore chose to port it to C. See figure~\ref{fig:sokobanscreen} for a screenshot of a level in Sokoban.

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/sokobanscreen.png}
\caption{A screenshot of a level in Sokoban.}
\label{fig:sokobanscreen}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Levels}
The levels are defined by it's dimensions and an array of characters of the different elements. For more information see the level format page on Sokoban Wiki \cite{sokobanlevel}. The  table~\ref{tab:levelformat} shows the level format we used. For an example of how the levels are designed, see figure~\ref{fig:leveldef}. This is level 1 and it is the simplest solvable level. The only move available is to push the box to the right. Figure~\ref{fig:level1} shows how it looks on the STK1000.

\subsection{Drivers}
In order to interact with the development board we wrote two separate device drivers. One for the LEDs and one for the buttons. In addition we used the framebuffer device to display images on the LCD and for sound we used the built in sound driver in Linux.

\section{How to setup, build and play}
\subsection{STK1000 setup}
Make sure that all the jumpers and cables are connected as described in section 4.3.3 in the TDT4258 Compendium \cite{komp}.
In addition, use the following setup for the GPIO, buttons and LEDs.

\begin{itemize}
\item Connect J1 to Switches
\item Connect J2 to Buttons
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Build instructions}
We've setup our build environment to automatically upload the necessary files to the development board. Should you want upload and run the compiled binaries yourself, then simply upload the files found in the \textit{bin} directory to the \textit{root} directory of the board and continue with the run instruction.

\paragraph{Drivers}
In the \textit{driver} directory, edit the \textit{compile\_and\_upload\_drivers.sh} script and set the correct IP address of the board. Then run the script which compiles and uploads them.

\paragraph{Game}
In the \textit{sokoban} directory, edit the \textit{Makefile} and again edit the IP of the board. Then run \textit{make} and \textit{make send}.

\subsection{Run instructions}
Connect to the board with \textit{Minicom} as described in the compendium. Run the \textit{drivers\_load.sh} script to load the drivers. Then to start the game, simply run the \textit{sokoban} executable. See figure~\ref{fig:consolestart} for the console output if the drivers and the game run successfully. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/consolestart.png}
\caption{Loading of device drivers and running the game from the console.}
\label{fig:consolestart}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Game} 
This exercise resulted in a working Sokoban game on the STK1000 development board. The game is played by using the buttons as a controller to move around in the game which is displayed on the LCD screen. In addition to a general "arrow key" setup, there is also a possibility to undo and redo with the buttons. For a quick view of how the game operates see our gameplay video on Youtube\cite{youtube}. At the start of the program you are prompted with a main menu where you can choose between 8 different levels. After finishing a level you have the option to go back to the main menu or press \textit{SW7} to end the game.

\subsection{LEDs and sounds}
We've used the LEDs to show how many boxes there are left that need to be moved. If you complete a level the lights will also blink and display a splash screen. As for sounds, we have intro music in the main menu, background music while playing and song for when you win. These all continue looping. Also, while playing there are sound effects for when you move, push boxes on targets, and hit a wall.

\subsection{Game controls}
The setup of the buttons are not ideal for playing the game, but for those who are familiar with the Unix layout for arrow keys first used in Vi text editor, it will be easy to play. The controls of the game are listed below in table~\ref{tab:gamecontrols}. 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \textbf{Switch} & \textbf{Action} \\ 
\hline SW7 & Move left \\ 
\hline SW6 & Move down \\ 
\hline SW5 & Move up \\ 
\hline SW4 & Move right \\ 
\hline SW3 & Undo move \\ 
\hline SW2 & Redo move \\ 
\hline SW1 & Reset level \\ 
\hline SW0 (x2) & Main menu \\
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Game controls} 
\label{tab:gamecontrols}
\end{table}

\section{Tests}
\subsection{Description}
We've created a few test scenarios in order to test different aspects of our game functionality. The tests were conducted by a person interacting with the switches and looking at the LCD screen, wearing a headset. Another person logged the results of the test. The main equipment was the STK1000 development board and a headset with the main focus on the LCD screen. The jumpers of the board were set as specified in the compendium (section 4.2) \cite{komp}. The GPIO was set up with both LEDs and switches connected to B as follows: LEDs on 8-15, switches on 0-7. 

\subsection{Results}
Below is a table of the different tests we ran, the preconditions and the results.

\section{Evaluation of assignment}
We found it interesting to learn more about the inner workings of Linux and how a device driver is written. We spent quite some time getting Linux to run on the STK1000 development board. This was much due to the original guide on the course site and Itslearning didn't really seem to work. At least no one that we talked to made it work by following that guide. After working together with another group who wrote the other guide posted later on Itslearning, we finally got it to work. 

\section{Conclusion}
During this exercise we have learned how to write Linux device drivers, how to run a Linux-variant on the STK1000 development board and implement a game in C on top of it. Most of the time was spent writing the drivers for controlling the LEDs and getting input from the buttons and also trying to interface with the other devices for the LCD and sound.
